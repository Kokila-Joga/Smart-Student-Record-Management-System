 Smart Student Record Management System (Java)

## Project Overview
The **Smart Student Record Management System** is a **console-based Java application** designed to manage student records efficiently.  
It implements **role-based access control** to differentiate between **Faculty** and **Student** users.

The system allows faculty members to manage student records, while students are restricted to viewing and searching records only.

This project demonstrates the use of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts and **basic access control mechanisms** in Java.
